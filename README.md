# JavaScript examples for addition and subtraction

Here are two JavaScript examples for addition and subtraction:

1.A simple, console-based example that shows the core functions.2.An interactive HTML file that uses those functions with input fields and buttons.1. Simple Console-Based DemoThis example contains just the JavaScript logic. You can run this code in a browser's developer console, or using a runtime environment like Node.js.I'll create a file named calculator_logic.js for this.

2. Interactive HTML DemoThis is a more complete demonstration in a single HTML file. It includes input fields for numbers, buttons to trigger the calculations, and a space to display the result.To use it, just save the code below as an HTML file (e.g., add_subtract_demo.html) and open it in your web browser.

The second example is great for a visual demo as it clearly shows the input, action, and output in a user-friendly way. Let me know if you have any other questions
